# DONR-Coin

# README



## The Problem 

Much of the money devoted to overseas aid and development is perceived to be lost through: 

● Misspending 

● Financial Transaction Charges - caused by banking inefficiencies, counter party risk etc 

● Theft 

This perception is undermining the political consensus that supports overseas aid as well as failing the vulnerable and poor for whom the aid is intended



## The Opportunity

A blockchain based stable coin issued by a trusted social business to replace the use of fiat currency and the banking system for the distribution of overseas aid money

A blockchain based stable coin brings:
● Transparency - money can be traced (unnecessary or inappropriate spending can be identified).
● Efficiency - Reduces the need for expensive, inefficient banking transactions and inter agency  bureaucracy
● Honesty - Thieves can be unmasked
● Flexibility - no bank fees and instant settlement allow funds to be transferred in small quantities on a real-time as needed basis



## How DONR.COIN will work

● DONR.ORG incorporated as a UK Social Enterprise or foundation
● DONR is a stable coin, issued by DONR.ORG on a blockchain in exchange for fiat.
● Fiat received by DONR.ORG will be banked and DONR coins created
● DONR will be redeemable for fiat at the original purchase price
● When DONR coins are exchanged with DONR.ORG for fiat, DONR.ORG will burn returned DONR coins
● Aid donors will purchase DONR from DONR.ORG
● Donors funds transferred to partners via on chain transaction denominated in the DONR coin



## DONR.COIN Implementation

DONR.ORG constituted as a social enterprise in the UK

- Will be regulated as an Electronic Money Issuer (EMI)
- Exchange fiat for DONR coins e.g DONR.GBP ISO 4127 XDP
- One type of DONR coin for each donor currency
- Local currency DONR coins e.g. DONR.KES (Kenyan Shilling)
- Govern access to blockchain
- Promote usage with donors and the community

### Wallet

● Custodial Wallets service “DONATE” provided by DONR.ORG for end users
● Non custodial wallets for member organizations



## Technology

- Can be done now - no new tech needed
- Use Private Ethereum PoA (Clique) network 200 TPS
- ERC20 style contracts to create tokens
